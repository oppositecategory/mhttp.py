# Galois

Galois is a small multithreaded websocket written in Python implementing message protocol above the TCP layer that mimicks the HTTP protocol with Elliptic Curve-Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) protocol above the sockets for communication.
Galois is in development and was written in order to get a better grasp of webservers and in Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
